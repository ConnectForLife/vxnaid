## Configuring the Iris Scan License
The iris scan functionality requires a Neurotechnology 'IrisExtractor' license.
Currently, the app expect an internet license file with the `.lic` extension to be placed on the SD-card in the directory:  
`/Android/data/com.jnj.vaccinetracker/files/Licenses`

In a future revision, the application will receive the license key directly from the backend server.
