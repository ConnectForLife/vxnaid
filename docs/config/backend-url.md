## Configuring the Backend URL
The backend system to connect to can be configured from the settings in the login screen of the app. This allows you to distribute the same application
`.apk` file for multiple deployments that connect to different backend systems.

1. On the login screen, tap the settings icon in the top-right.

2. In the Backend URL field, enter the URL for the backend server to connect to. This value will be stored and thus only needs to be configured once.
